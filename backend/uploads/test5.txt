React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix[a]. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.[11][12] A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements
